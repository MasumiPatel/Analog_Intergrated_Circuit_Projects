- Design of Low Dropout (LDO) Regulator (coming soon)


###  Parameters set uesd for the design of Differential Amplifier

- Vdd = 1.6V, total current from supply: IVDD<170 uA.
- Load Cap: CL = 1 pF
- Gain >= 33 dB.
- Output swing >= 1.2 Vpp.
- BW>2.5 MHz

###  Parameters set used for the design of two stage Operational Amplifier

- Vdd = 1.6V, total current from supply: IVDD<170 uA.
- Load Cap: CL = 1 pF
- Gain >= 33 dB.
- Output swing >= 1.2 Vpp.
- BW>2.5 MHz

### Getting Started
To explore the project or replicate its findings:

1.Ensure you have Cadence Virtuoso installed on your system.

2.Clone the project repository to your local machine:

3.Copy code

        git clone https://github.com/MasumiPatel/Analog_Intergrated_Circuit_Projects.git

4.Design the circuit as given in the report with proper width and length values and ensure that all the transistors used in the system as in saturation region

5.Run the required simulations like DC, AC, Gain&Phase, Transient analysis to verify the design parameters
